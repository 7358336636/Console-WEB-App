            A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard. It is a rudimentary interface in which the 
            monitor provides the output and the keyboard is used for input. ... Modern consoles often provide a
            graphical interface that can be used to control machines on a local network (LAN) or provide remote
            access to remote systems.

            You should use the console. log() method to print to console JavaScript. The JavaScript console log()
            function is mainly used for code debugging as it makes the JavaScript print the output to the console.
            To open the browser console, right-click on the page and select Inspect, and then click Console

            In Windows terms, a Console is a textual GUI window that you see when you run "cmd.exe".
            It allows you to write text to, and read text from, a window without the window having
            any other UI chrome such as toolbars, menus, tabs, etc,..
